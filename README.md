# MyChatApp

**MyChatApp** is a web-based chat application that allows users to interact with the OpenAI-powered assistant, Luna. Users can start new threads, re-engage old conversations, and view saved chat threads from previous sessions. Built with Flask, OpenAI API, and ChromaDB for thread management, this application enables seamless chat-based interaction.

## Features

- **Start New Threads**: Users can initiate new conversations with Luna.
- **Re-engage Previous Conversations**: Users can select saved threads from the sidebar and continue their chat from where they left off.
- **Session Management**: Each session maintains its thread history, allowing users to continue their chats across sessions.
- **Real-time Assistant Interaction**: Powered by OpenAI, MyChatApp responds intelligently to user inputs within each conversation thread.
